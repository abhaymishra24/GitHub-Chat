GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code. 
Storing your code in a "repository" on GitHub allows you to: Showcase or share your work.
Track and manage changes to your code over time.

## Project Description✍️
In this project, I am creating a group and individual chat system for the GitHub platform, where users can communicate about projects with other users.
In this chat system, they can share photos, documents, links, etc.
Users can chat with their followers as well as random GitHub users for discussions and idea exchanges.
