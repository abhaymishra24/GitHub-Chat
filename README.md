GitHub is a cloud-based platform where you can store, share, and work together with others to write code. 
Storing your code in a "repository" on GitHub allows you to: Showcase or share your work.
Track and manage changes to your code over time.
- I am trying to build a chat system on the GitHub platform for discussions in groups and individually about projects and ideas.
